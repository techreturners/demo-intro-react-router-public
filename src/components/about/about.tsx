    <h2 className='subtitle'>About This Site</h2>
    <p>This site represents a state of mind.</p>
    <p>Navigating through the world can be intimidating. It can feel as if we are lost. That we lack <strong>routes</strong>.</p>
    <p>A site filled with routes might be just what we need when we feel directionless.</p>
    <p>Or it might just be fun to click on things and watch them change.</p>
    <p>It's up to you.</p>
