# Tech Demo for 'Intro to React Router'

`demo` branch contains the STARTING point for the demo


`main` branch contains a complete solution

* Clone the repo
* Run `git checkout demo` to get to the starting point
* Follow the instructions in the session plan
* At the end, you can run 'git reset --hard' to reset your local demo to the starting position
* If you need to jump to a complete solution at any point, run 'git checkout main' for that "here's one I made earlier" feeling.
